            <p>
                I implemented iterative denoising for a diffusion model using **strided timesteps** to skip redundant steps, improving efficiency while preserving image quality. Starting with a noisy image at a high timestep, I used a U-Net to predict the noise and estimate the clean image, iteratively refining it across progressively less noisy timesteps. The denoising process interpolates between the noisy input and the predicted clean signal using diffusion-specific parameters like \( \alpha_t \), \( \beta_t \), and \( \bar{\alpha}_t \). By skipping steps with strided timesteps, the model efficiently reconstructs high-quality images without the need for full-timestep computations. I visualized the gradual denoising process and compared the results to single-step denoising and Gaussian blurring, demonstrating the superiority of the iterative approach. This project highlights the power of diffusion models in balancing computational efficiency and high-quality image restoration.

            <p>
                In this part, I implemented **Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)** to improve the quality of generated images by combining conditional and unconditional noise estimates. The denoising process involves calculating a weighted combination of these estimates, controlled by a guidance scale \( \gamma \), where higher values amplify the conditional guidance for better image fidelity. I created a function, `iterative_denoise_cfg`, that iteratively refines noisy inputs using both a meaningful text prompt and an empty ("null") prompt to guide the generation process. Using this function, I generated five images with a CFG scale of \( \gamma = 7 \), which balances conditional alignment and diversity. This approach produces sharper, more detailed images compared to standard diffusion methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of classifier-free guidance.

                In this part, I used **SDEdit** to edit images by adding varying levels of noise and then iteratively denoising them using **Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)**. For each noise level (\(1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20\)), I added noise to the original image to push it away from the image manifold and used a diffusion model with the prompt "a high quality photo" to guide it back. The denoising process forced the noisy images to align with the natural image manifold, gradually restoring details while preserving edits induced by the noise. I repeated this procedure for three test images, producing a range of outputs for each noise level, showing progressively refined versions as the noise level decreased. This approach demonstrates the modelâ€™s ability to creatively edit and restore images while balancing between the original content and new generative adjustments.

        <section class="procedure">
            <h2>Visual Anagrams</h2>
            <p>
This code implements a **visual anagram creation** process where an image changes its semantic content depending on its orientation, based on prompts like "an oil painting of an old man" and "an oil painting of people around a campfire." The key idea is to iteratively denoise an image with **Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)** for two different text prompts: one for the original image orientation and one for its flipped version. The denoising is guided by conditional and unconditional noise estimates, combined with a scaling factor to control the strength of the guidance.

For each timestep \(t\), the code computes the conditional noise estimates for both prompts using the U-Net. It also calculates the unconditional noise estimates by passing the same images through the model with an empty prompt. These estimates are combined using CFG to calculate the guided noise estimates, where:
\[
\text{noise\_est\_cfg} = \text{uncond\_noise\_est} + \text{scale} \cdot (\text{cond\_noise\_est} - \text{uncond\_noise\_est}).
\]

For the flipped version of the image, the process is repeated after flipping the image vertically, and the resulting noise estimate is flipped back to align with the original image orientation. The final noise estimate is then averaged across the two prompts (original and flipped) to harmonize the two semantic interpretations. 

The resulting noise estimate is used to compute the clean image estimate for the current timestep using the equation:
\[
\text{clean\_est} = \frac{\text{image} - \text{noise\_est\_final} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t}}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}}.
\]

The predicted image for the previous timestep is computed by interpolating between the clean image estimate and the current noisy image, with variance correction added using the predicted variance from the U-Net. This iterative denoising process ensures that the final image contains visual elements corresponding to both prompts, depending on the orientation of the image. The code successfully demonstrates how to generate creative visual anagrams by leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models.

            <h2>Visual Anagrams</h2>
            <p>
                This code implements **Factorized Diffusion** to create hybrid images that combine low and high-frequency components from two separate noise estimates generated using different prompts. Specifically, it creates an image that appears as a "lithograph of a skull" when viewed from a distance but resembles "a lithograph of waterfalls" when viewed up close. The process involves iteratively denoising the image while separating the frequency components of two noise estimates using Gaussian blurring.

For each timestep \(t\), the code calculates the **conditional noise estimates** (\(\epsilon_{1}, \epsilon_{2}\)) for the two prompts and their respective **unconditional noise estimates** using the U-Net. These estimates are combined using **Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)**, where the final guided noise for each prompt is:
\[
\text{noise\_est} = \text{uncond\_noise} + \text{scale} \cdot (\text{cond\_noise} - \text{uncond\_noise}).
\]
The low-frequency component is extracted by applying a Gaussian blur (\(kernel\_size=33, sigma=2\)) to the first noise estimate. The high-frequency component is derived by subtracting the blurred version of the second noise estimate from itself. These components are combined to form the final noise estimate:
\[
\text{noise\_est\_final} = \text{low\_pass} + \text{high\_pass}.
\]

The denoised image for the current timestep is computed using:
\[
\text{clean\_est} = \frac{\text{image} - \text{noise\_est\_final} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t}}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}},
\]
where \(\alpha_t\) and \(\beta_t = 1 - \alpha_t\) are timestep-dependent noise parameters. The predicted image for the previous timestep is calculated by interpolating between the clean estimate and the noisy image, while incorporating the predicted variance to stabilize the results.

This process is repeated iteratively across the timesteps, gradually refining the image to combine the high and low frequencies of the prompts. The result is a visually compelling hybrid image that seamlessly integrates the features of the two concepts, leveraging the capabilities of diffusion models for creative compositional outputs.
